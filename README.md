<h2>Description</h2>

This guide is an attempt to help anyone that is interested in learning about why Active Directory is useful, applying the knowledge, and developing more skills for the workplace. 

<br />

This documentation will walk you through setting up an Active Directory Lab using a virtual machine (VirtualBox). 

<br />

Active Directory is a great way to learn practical knowledge that is used in an enterprise environment, which makes is a great starting point for anyone trying to learn more about IT and develop skills that are used in jobs ranging from Help Desk to Cybersecurity positions. 

<br />

After completing this lab, you will have learned more about why Active Directory is so useful, how to apply that knowledge in the workplace, and a lab environment to practice more on your own. 



<h2>Environments Used and Downloads</h2>

- <b>Oracle VirtualBox</b> 
- <b>Windows Server 2022</b>
- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Prerequisites</h3> 


<h3>IT Knowledge</h3> 

You don't need to know all of these things or any of them in great depth, but the more you know, the less googling you will have to do. 
<br />

- Basic understanding of what different hardware components do, such as CPU, RAM, HDD, NIC, etc
- Basic understanding of computer networking, such as IP, subnets, default gateways, etc
- Basic understanding of Client-Server model 
- Basic understanding of different services such as DHCP, DNS, NAT, etc 





<h3>Hardware</h3> 

You don't need these things, but they are recommended for optimizing your VM's performance. 
<br />

- 8GB+ of RAM is ideal (Attempt even if under 8GB)
- 100GB+ of unused storage (Windows 10 and Server 2022 require a minimum 32GB of unused storage each) 


## Downloads 

### Virtual Machine (Oracle VirtualBox)

Download the VirtualBox and the Extension from:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

## Introduction to Virtual Machines 

### What is a Virtual Machine? 

An easy way to describe a virtual machine is "a computer inside of a computer". 

Imagine you were to open any program, such as Google Chrome, but the window that pops up shows you a Windows 10, MacOS, or Linux system that you can interact with -- just like any other computer. It's like you have two different computers on one screen.


When you create a virtual machine on your personal computer, you allocate some resources from your physical computer (CPU, RAM, HDD/SDD, NIC, etc) to be used for the virtual machine. So if you were to allocate 33% of your CPU usage to the VM, every time you launch that VM, 33% of your CPU would be dedicated to it. The same applies with RAM. 

Host machine refers to the PC you are physically using, and the operating system that is on it. Guest machine refers to the virtual machine. 

The way that your computer (without a virtual machine) typically manages its resources is through the operating system. So, if you were using Windows 10, it would be interacting directly with the hardware. However, specialized hypervisor software allows the hardware

### Why a Virtual Machine? 

Useful for cloud enterprise, but also personal use. 

Buying dedicated computers to run server software is costly. It is also tedious to use your personal every-day computer (without a virtual machine) as a lab. You might break something that needs fixing, and you don't have a very functional computer in the meantime. If you use a Virtual Machine, you can just delete it, and start again. 


## Installing VirtualBox 

- Open your "Downloads" folder, or where you saved the VirtualBox installation file
- Execute the VirtualBox installation file
- Agree to all prompts 


## Setting up a Virtual Machine

- Launch Virtual Box if it's not already open 
- Select the blue icon called "New" 
- Name the Virtual Machine "Windows Server 2022" (or something similar)
- Keep the default Machine Folder, or change it if you prefer a different path
- Keep the Type as Microsoft Windows 
- Change the Version to "Others Windows (64-bit)"
- Select "Next"
